# FizzBuzz

## For the numbers 1 - 100
### When the number is divisible by 3, output fizz
### When the number is divisible by 5, output buzz
### When the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, output fizzbuzz
### When the number is not divisible by either 3 or 5, output the number

# For extra credit

### Extend the application to support any input of numbers, for example, 15 - 175

See [my number source implementation](https://github.com/CraigCav/FizzBuzz/tree/master/FizzbuzzExample/FizzBuzz/NumberSource) for an example

### Extend the application to support additional rules; for example, output "baz" for numbers divisible by 4

See [my rules tests](https://github.com/CraigCav/FizzBuzz/blob/master/FizzbuzzExample/Fizzbuzz.Tests/RuleTests.cs) for an example test case

### Extend the application to support [other rules](https://github.com/CraigCav/FizzBuzz/tree/master/FizzbuzzExample/FizzBuzz/Rules) to be defined at a later date
